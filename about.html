<h1>Reinvent yourself</h1>

<p>To paraphrase Mike Tyson,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every woman has a plan until her first child is born.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>The glory years, part un</h2>

<p>I used to be a hotshot in my early 20s - for starters, I rubbed elbows with the finance minister of Hungary. Not because of the nepotism of contacts: it was a direct consequence of leading research on the effects of flat tax on the Hungarian economy. I kept conducting further research on finance and taxes, have been active in the Ruby community, gave the valedictorian speech at my university, etc.</p>

<h2>Welcome to the Jungle</h2>

<p>Then came the children - three of them. The first one never saw the light, thanks to the ‘fantastic’ counsel of some doctors (‘nature took out the trash’ is what he literally said.).</p>

<p>But two of them did - and they are the most precious, awesome kids I know, a constant source of joy and excitement.</p>

<p>Short after the girls were born, we sold everything that didn’t fit into a few suitcases and lived all over the place. This self-imposed sabbatical was one of the most rewarding things in my life so far: immersing ourselves into foreign cultures, surrounded by exotic experiences, watching our kids absorbing the world around them as they grew up was pure bliss!</p>

<p>They also (unwillingly) shattered my dreams, wholly and utterly obliterating my plans, forcing me on a path I would have never taken in my pre-mother days.</p>

<p>Would I hit the ‘undo’ button if life came with that feature? Not.</p>

<p>Do I love every day I spend with them? Absolutely!</p>

<p>That doesn’t change the fact that I got isolated from everyone I knew in my previous professional life, and I don’t just mean finance-minister level figures, but everyone. My budding career came to a screeching halt, my achievements forgotten, my notebooks full of ideas and plans collecting dust in my mom’s basement.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the effect of getting out of sight entirely for a few years (more like a full decade in my case).</p>

<p>I can’t say I’m not bitter a teeny bit, regretful even, thinking about all the could-have-beens.</p>

<p>Negative emotions are not the point of this monologue, though.</p>

<h2>The glory years, part deux</h2>

<p>The point is, that:</p>

<p>I am back.</p>

<p>With a vengeance.</p>

<p>Time to dust off those notebooks.</p>

<p>Time to catch up for the missed opportunities.</p>

<p>Time to reinvent myself.</p>

<p>Time to start making.</p>

<p>Time to start helping others doing the same.</p>

<p>We are full of ideas (who isn’t?!), but instead of just banging them out and see what sticks, we are turning the journey into a product itself.</p>

<p>Speaking of products: we are also meticulously documenting the processes, thinking, design, implementation, marketing and every other aspect of creating them. Being off the map for years is actually a blessing in disguise: we are very well aware what are we missing and thus we are well positioned to cater to new bootstrappers/makers.</p>

<p>We could say that we are meta-bootstrapping: bootstrapping future bootstrappers; and not just any bootstrappers, but specifically women, with focus on Africa, Asia, and Eastern-Europe.</p>

<p>Why women? Because women are awesome - and underrepresented, undervalued, underappreciated and not receiving nearly enough visibility. It’s a shame, as they are bringing unique powers, vision, and qualities to the table. Why have +-10% of awesomeness when we can have more, hopefully WAY more?!</p>

<p>To put our money where our mouth is, we just started working on the branding of SHEmagine.com, a community and platform for up-and-coming femtrepreneurs and female bootstrappers, giving them an opportunity to showcase their work, educating, mentoring and helping them however we can (financially as well - part of our profits will go towards scholarships/funding exciting projects).</p>

<p>Also, the ‘kids’ I keep mentioning are two girls - we will do everything in our power to build a world where women are not second-class citizens, but respected and equal peers to men. We are creating SHEmagine for them too!</p>
